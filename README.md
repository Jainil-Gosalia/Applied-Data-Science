<h1>Introduction</h1> 
</n>
<p>The purpose of this repository is to serve as an archive for the implementation of several machine learning algorithms. This will help me understand and implement a myriad of usecases of many of these algorithms. 
A fundamental understanding of the concepts of these algorithms and how they are implemented will be explained for each of them in respective directory.
