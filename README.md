<h1>Welcome</h1>
</n>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</n>
<p>The purpose of this repository is to serve as an archive for the implementation of several different data science algorithms. These include data mining, soft computing, data visualization, rule based, machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This will help me understand and implement a myriad of usecases of many of these algorithms using messy real world data for practical applications. 
A fundamental understanding of the concepts of these algorithms and how they are implemented is explained for each of them in their respective directory.
</n>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The format for presentation of these algorithms is jupyter notebooks. In each of the directory, there will be a markdown file explaining in detail the dataset, the problem statement,  the algorithm selected for solution, the python packages used, implementation and results; a jupyter notebook detailing the step by step execution and a the dataset or a link to the dataset if the size of the dataset exceeds 25mb.
